For my MonoGame Game program, I decided to add moving enemies as my additional game feature.
These enemies take the form from the Enemy class, which inherits from the GameObject class. Whenever
the player makes contact with one of these enemies, the game ends instantly (and the player loses).

The enemies start appearing on level 3, where there exist two enemies traveling in vertical directions
on the screen. The time is also increased from 10 seconds to 15 seconds, as to allow time for the user
to move around the enemies. Two more enemies join the fight on level 7 onwards. These new additional
enemies travel in horizontal directions, in addition to the vertial traveling ones. Once again, the time
is also increased to 20 seconds as to allow for even more time to move around the obstacles.
